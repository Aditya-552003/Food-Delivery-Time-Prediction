# Food Delivery Status Prediction
## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced food delivery services, predicting whether an order will arrive on time is crucial for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
This project builds a machine learning model to predict delivery status based on various features like order time, traffic conditions, restaurant location, and delivery distance.

## Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

* Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

* Machine Learning Algorithms:

* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [experimental]

* Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

* Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)


## Key Steps
### Data Preprocessing:

* Handling missing values

* Feature extraction

* Encoding categorical variables

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Correlation analysis

* Visualization of features

### Model Building:

* Training classification models

* Fine-tuning hyperparameters

### Association Rule Mining:

* Finding relationships between features

### Evaluation:

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

* Confusion matrix analysis
